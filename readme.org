* clause.el

This repo provides functions to move by clause, mark by clause, and kill by clause.

A clause is delimited by =,= =;= =:= =(= =)= and =â€“=, in addition to the characters in =sentence-end=. If you want to add any extra clause delimiters, customize =clause-extra-delimiters=.

It should handle org footnotes correctly too, if they aren't inline.
